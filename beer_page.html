Since opening our doors in 2001, our goal has been to create traditional European style beers while maintaining the unique flavor that is Asheville. Our tasty creations can be found all over North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, with new territories coming soon.

Currently the Brewery offers six staple, year-round beers: the Wee-Heavy-Er Scotch Ale, 13 Rebels ESB, IPA, Ryehopper, Gateway Kolsch, and Anvil Porter. These are always on tap at the Tasting Room, open from 1 PM to 8 PM Monday-Sunday, along with an assortment of seasonal specialties, and frequently a beer on cask. Pints at the Tasting Room (typically $3.50) are a dollar off on Mondays, and growler refills (typically $7.00/$8.00)  are a dollar off Wednesdays.
